# Device-Tree-TRUE-SLIM-SSB-508D
TWRPBuilder tree output for TRUE SLIM SSB-508D



TWRPBuilder Tree Generator downloaded from : 
https://github.com/TwrpBuilder/twrpbuilder_tree_generator/releases/latest

More info on the TWRP Builder project : 
https://www.xda-developers.com/twrp-builder-project-developers-request-unofficial-twrp-ports/




NOTE : 
I did NOT write/develop/etc. any part of the tree generator nor am I any part of the TWRP Builder project.  I am including 
the output generated because I could not find any source, device tree, or reference to one for this android.  There is a typo 
in the original build prop listing the vendor as "TURE SLIM" and it was (of course) picked up by the tree generator.  I 
will be including the original boot and recovery images copied with the TWRPBuilder app. Device specs listed below. 
Hope this helps someone, I spent hours combing XDA and searching google so others wouldn't have to......
